# POWER--A-crowdsourcing-and-freelancing-portal
POWER is a platform in which individuals or organisations obtain goods and services, including ideas and finances from a large group of users. We have provided an online portal named POWER (Promotion of women empowerment and rights) for such a crowdsourcing platform for the Indian government especially for women. - We have used Aadhar/PAN verification for accepting only legitimate users on our website. - To connect all parts of the Indian community we have incorporated multilinguality and IVR features for people in rural parts. - We have used natural language processing and image processing algorithms of Machine Learning to find offensive projects posted or offensive comments posted. - We have also used Artifical Intelligence algorithms to detect fraud detection in transaction process by all users.
